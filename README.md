# 7-Segment Binary to Hexadecimal Decoder using Logic Gates

- This project implements a binary to hexadecimal decoder displayed on a 7-segment display, built using basic logic gates on ** Circuitverse.org **.
- I've made made it to get a better understanding of how digital logic gates work and can be implemented in real world applications.
