# 7-Segment Binary to Hexadecimal Decoder using Logic Gates

This project implements a binary to hexadecimal decoder displayed on a 7-segment display, built using basic logic gates on Circuitverse.org.
I've made made it to get a better understanding of how logic gates work and how they can be implemented in real world applications.
